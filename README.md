This project is supposed to be a RPG-strategy game playable on Windows.
It’s goal is to have fun while playing. It consists of log-in system, operations on structures, strings, functions and files, and it’s unique travel, level-up and battle system. It uses loops, and rand functions. It also has it’s own HELP menu.
To play this game you should type the number of option, word (displayed in caps) or answer a question. Until level 5 it is a kid of RPG game (you have to do quests, defeat enemies in 1vs1 battle, to gain experience and raise your attributes), from lvl 5 and up to maximum lvl 10 you can recruit army, travel to another towns to obtain pacts so you can strengthen your army. To win the game you must defeat the forces of the last town (don’t go there until you are sure you have strong enough army). During the game you can buy some equipment.

The game allows also some conveniences:
	almost anytime while playing you can type ‘card’ to open your character card and see your stats,
	there are some cheats (while in shop type ‘RobinHood’ to get 500 gold, while in quest menu type ‘IwantBeAKing’ to jump up to lvl 5, and when you fight in army vs army battle type ‘MasterOfPower’ to instantly win the battle)
